My first project with HTML and CSS.

This site about the course of programming, and rules of organizing indents.

This site have 3 pages:
1. index.html - explorer between pages, and download link.
2. modules.html - information about the modules and parts of that course.
3. article.html - An article about the rules for organizing indents.

Thanks for watching me, have a nice day.
